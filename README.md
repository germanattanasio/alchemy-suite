## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

  [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

  ```none
applications:
  name: <application-name>
  command: node app.js
  path: .
  memory: 256M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

5. ADD the alchemy key(create one [here](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html)) to your environment

  ```sh
  $ cf se <application-name> ALCHEMY_KEY <alchemy-key>
  ```

## Running locally

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
    `npm install`
3. Replace the `<alchemy-api>` placeholder
